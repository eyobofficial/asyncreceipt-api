## Instruction on How to Run the Receipt Generating API locally

### Method 1: Using `Docker` and `docker-compose` (Recommended)
Make sure you have installed the latest docker ecosystem tools (i.e. Docker Engine, Docker CLI, Docker Machine, and docker-compose). After that, follow the following steps:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine and change your working directory to the repository directory.
```
$ git clone <repo-url>
$ cd <repo-directory>
```
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` file. Change the values in the file accordingly.
3. Run the following command:
```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Wait until the container build is complete. Now your endpoints should be available on `http://127.0.0.1:3000/receipts/`.


### Method 2: Manual Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.8, Pipenv, and Redis installed.

**Linux**
Steps:
1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine and change your working directory to the repository directory.
```
$ git clone <repo-url>
$ cd <repo-directory>
```
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` file. Change the values in the file accordingly.
3. Create and activate a new python virtual enviroment using the following command:
```
$ pipenv shell
```
4. Run the following commands:
```
$ pipenv install
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver
```

5. Start your redis server
```
$ sudo service redis-server start
```

6. Start celery workers
```
$ celery -A config worker -l info
```

Now your endpoints should be available on `http://127.0.0.1:3000/receipts/`.
